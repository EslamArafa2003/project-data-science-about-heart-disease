we work on dataset about (heart disease).
we add two code. 
fist code we use the data sceince.
second code we use machine learning algorithms.
our ML (algorithms):
  1) logistic regression.
  2) Naive Bayes.
  3) SVC.
  4) KNN.
  5) Decision tree.
  6) Random forest.
  7) Neural network.
  
finally, we add our dataset excel sheet,one presentation and one pdf (All these will help you to understand our work well).

Have Fun
